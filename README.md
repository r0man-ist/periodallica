# periodallica
This is a very basic python script to bulk-download the full text of journal issues in Gallica using the parent-ARK of the BNF catalogue général. Useful for journals with no/unknown rate of publication, as (other than (Pyllica)[https://api.bnf.fr/fr/extracteur-python-de-corpus-de-periodiques]) it looks up the individual issues via the api first.
